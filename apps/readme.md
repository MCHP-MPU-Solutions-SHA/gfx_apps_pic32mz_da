# Example Applications

The following applications are provided to demonstrate both basic and advanced Graphics capabilities of the PIC32 MZ DA Family.

## Legato Library Examples 


* [Legato Dashboard Round](./legato_dashboard_round/readme.md)

This application presents a vehicle dashboard User Interface (UI) for a round display on the PIC32MZ DA Radial Graphics Development Board. It can switch between a gauge that shows the engine RPM (tachometer) or another gauge that shows speed; The position of the gauge needle can be controlled thru the touch screen or thru the rotary knob.

* [Legato Showcase Round](./legato_showcase_round/readme.md)

This application showcases a Smart Home Control User Interface (UI) in a round display with the PIC32MZ DA Radial Graphics Development Board. It demonstrates multiple user interface controls for common Smart Home appliance and utility controls like the thermostat, fan, lighting, audio, etc. The demo uses the round touch screen and a rotary knob to receive touch and wheel gestures and input from the user.
